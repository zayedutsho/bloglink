              The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets
              are known as global variables and have global scope. Global
              scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
              that program, any function or conditional state can access that
              variable. .

              Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope

              brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
              conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed
              to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

      <h3>3. How does JS eventloop work?</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="fw-bold fs-4  ">Ans.</span> JavaScript is an high level,
        interpreted, single threaded non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent
        language.
        <br />
        <span class="fw-bold">Single thread</span>
        <br />
        A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed
        instruction that can be managed independently by a scheduler. A
        programming language is single-threaded means it can only perform one
        task or operation at a single time. This means it would execute an
        entire process from start to end without the thread being interrupted
        or stopped. Unlike multi-threaded languages where multiple processes
        can be run on several threads concurrently without blocking each
        other.
        <br />
        <span class="fw-bold">Non-blocking</span>
        <br />
        There is no one definition of blocking; it just simply means things
        that are running slowly on the thread. So non-blocking means things
        that aren’t slow on the thread.
        <br />
        <span class="fw-bold">Concurrent</span>
        <br />
        Concurrency means that the code is being executed concurrently by more
        than one thread.
        <br />
        <span class="fw-bold">Asynchronous</span>
        <br />
        Asynchronous programming means that the code runs in an event loop.
        When there is a blocking operation, the event is started. The blocking
        code keeps running without blocking the main execution thread. When
        the blocking code finishes running, it queue’s the result of the
        blocking operations and pushes them back to the stack.
        <br />
        <span class="fw-bold">Conclusion</span>
        <br />
        While this is a very basic introduction, the concept of asynchronous
        programming in JavaScript gives enough insight to clearly understand
        what is going on under the hood and how JavaScript is able to run
        concurrently and asynchronously with just a single thread.
